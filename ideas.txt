feedback workshop style possibilities

- scenario-style (feedback workshop style)
- Sumeet's drawing-feedback workshop
- lecture style on the theory or feedback (probably with powerpoints)
- actual give-each-other-feedback (360-style: all spend 1 min writing feedback for person A, they review it aloud, repeat for person B..)
- actual give-each-other-feedback (retro-style: everyone puts post-its on each person's section of board)
- open discussion (one strategy at a time, we discuss one-sentence feedback strategy descriptions- one per slide)
- bookclub-style (send out an article on feedback, everyone read it, then we put it on the board and discuss it)


(stolen from Rich Feller's presentation) - 
1. You (A) make a statement that you think your pair (B) will disagree with strongly
2. pair (B): draw out (A), try to get them to explain why they think this
