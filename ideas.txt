feedback workshop possibilities

do sumeet's workshop, possibly with variations
"find a person who can be on your right for the purpose of passing them a sheet of paper"
draw a picture, give them one piece of positive
how did giving them that positive feedback go?
now give them constructive feedback
how did that feedback giving go? did you feel awkward? Did they feel awkward?
