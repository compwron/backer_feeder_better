Situation: Alice seems to be ignoring your suggestions


Phrasing ideas: 

"I feel like you're not listening to me. What can I do to say more useful things?"

"I might not be explaining this the best way- can you help me talk about it?"

"Can we draw a diagram?"

"I really think we should stop and talk about this before we code."
