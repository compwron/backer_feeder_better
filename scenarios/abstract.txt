Situation: (This is an abstract scenario to use for phrasing rather than content suggestions) Alice keeps doing foo and you think that Bar would be better.


Phrasing ideas: 

"Alice, can we talk about Foo for a minute?"

"I really like Bar, and I think it's mutually exclusive with Foo."

"I see that we have Foo here. Can I ask why is that?"

"Can you help me understand why Foo is good here?"

"Can you help me understand why Foo is better than Bar here?"
