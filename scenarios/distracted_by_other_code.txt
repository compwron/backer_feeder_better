Situation: While fixing one bug, Bob will get distracted by other code and go to fix it, and so on- for quite a while.


Phrasing ideas: (not all of these are ideal!)

"Your attention span is two seconds long and it's driving me crazy."

"What do you think of how we pass control of the keyboard back and forth?"

"I think we should do one thing at once; can we write this down and come back to it?"

"I think we're lost track of what we were doing; how is this related?"

"Can we talk about workflow for a minute? I work better when we do one thing at once."

"I want to write down the thing we're working on, on a post-it note, so when we get distracted we won't lose track of the goal."

"Can we talk about workflow for a minute? I'd prefer if you give me more warning before taking control of the keyboard; it's very startling."

"When we're pairing today, I'm going to try to let you know that I want to type by leaning forward and hovering my hands over the keyboard. Do you think that's okay?"
