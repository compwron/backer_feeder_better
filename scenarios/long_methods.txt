Situation: Alice is consistently writing very long methods


Phrasing ideas: (Do not consider these all ideal!)

"This method is way too long"

"I'm concerned about this method; it's very long."

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with adding more to this method; it's very long."

"Alice, can we take a walk and talk about code style?"

"Alice, can I send you some links on where I get my ideas about code?"
